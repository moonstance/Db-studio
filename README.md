# 🧠 DbStudio

**DbStudio** is a fast, lightweight C# script editor for interacting with databases — starting with RavenDB.

Write and run C# scripts directly against your RavenDB (or other DBs in the future) using the power of [RoslynPad](https://github.com/aelij/RoslynPad) — in a clean, modern interface inspired by tools like SQL Management Studio.

> 💡 Ideal for power users and developers who want fast database access through C# scripting — no boilerplate, no build step.
